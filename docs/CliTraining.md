# Training from CLI

All training functionality is available though a single CLI command. To see all available options,
run `python scripts/train.py -h` from within the active venv. Some options require specifying paths to files with a
specific layout. These files can be created using the create_train_files.py script. You can call the script like
this `python scripts/create_train_files.py -h`

To simplify the creation of the training command, you can export your settings from the UI by using the export button.
